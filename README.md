# TinyFootprint
An app that helps users track and categorize the waste they produce each day—such as cardboard, plastic, or compostable materials. By logging their habits, users can see how much waste or energy they’ve saved over time and visualize their digital footprint. It encourages small, daily actions that add up to a meaningful environmental impact.
